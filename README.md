# Driver-drowsiness-detection
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for detecting driver drowsiness. 
There are two ways of detecting: one is by detecting occurence of yawning, which triggers an alarm after
some threshold period; the other one is by detecting the state of eyes of a driver.
It has three classes: open, half-closed and closed while the first detector has classes awake and drowsy.
Detection is implemented using YOLOv5 object detection and is demonstrated on web camera.
